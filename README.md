# Dog racing:

### Introduction
This repository has the purpose of practicing Refactoring, for a better understanding you should check the commit history.

So initially, the first commit is a copy from a beginner object-oriented programming student's project, with the only exception of me creating a package named "DogRacing", which is a dog racing application.

The second commit, as an exception to the rule, is going to be me refactoring the code just for a translation from spanish to english language.

After that, I am going to add some tests with JUnit and Mockito, and ever since then I am going to try to detect known smell codes and refactor the project without changing its behaviour.

### About functionality
The application will ask the user for a name and a breed for two dogs. Each dog will have his speed calculated based on the race and some random factor. Then they will run a race. The winner, will be able to choose a special price.
